/*----------------------Challenges-----------------*/
/*Challenge 1
Join the 'Track' table and the 'MediaType' table to create a query that shows the Name of the Track, and the Name of the Media Type. Both tables have a 'MediaTypeId' column that you can join on.

            Expected Result: 3503 rows (Here's a sample, actual tracks may be different)

            For Those About To Rock (We Salute You) MPEG audio file
            Balls to the Wall                       Protected AAC audio file
            Fast As a Shark	                        Protected AAC audio file*/
desc Track;
desc MediaType;
select Track.Name as Track, MediaType.Name as 'Media Type' from Track
    inner join MediaType on Track.MediaTypeId = MediaType.MediaTypeId;

/*Challenge 2
Similar Query to above, but join the track table to the Genre table, show the names of the tracks and genres in the results. Figure out the columns you can join on, any aliases that you need. Filter the results to only show 'Jazz' tracks

            Expected: 130 rows (Here's a sample, actual tracks may be different)

            Desafinado	                              Jazz
            Garota De Ipanema	                      Jazz
            Samba De Uma Nota SÃ³ (One Note Samba)	  Jazz

/*Challenge 3
Create a Query that shows: The name of a track, the name of it's MediaType, and the name of it's genre. You'll need to join 3 tables together with the appropriate join columns. Add a filter to only show tracks with a MediaType of "Protected AAC audio file" and a Genre of "Soundtrack".

            Expected: 1 row

            Koyaanisqatsi	    Protected AAC audio file	    Soundtrack

/*Challenge 4
Filter to only show results for the 'Grunge' playlist
