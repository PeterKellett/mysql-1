Join the 'Track' table and the 'MediaType' table to create a query that shows the Name of the Track, and the Name of the Media Type. Both tables have a 'MediaTypeId' column that you can join on.

Similar Query to above, but join the track table to the Genre table, show the names of the tracks and genres in the results. Figure out the columns you can join on, any aliases that you need. Filter the results to only show 'Jazz' tracks

Create a Query that shows: The name of a track, the name of it's MediaType, and the name of it's genre. You'll need to join 3 tables together with the appropriate join columns. Add a filter to only show tracks with a MediaType of "Protected AAC audio file" and a Genre of "Soundtrack".
